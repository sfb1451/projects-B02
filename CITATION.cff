abstract: Project B02 investigates motor network maturation in children and adolescents.
  Multi-channel EEG source localisation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and functional
  magnetic resonance imaging will be used to unravel how emerging frontal cortical
  activation accomplishes improved motor control and how disturbed maturation leads
  to involuntary tic movements.
